## 2.0.0

- **Flutter 3.x+ support** – upgraded minimum SDK & migrated to null‑safety across all components.
- **Refactored recording UI** – unified press‑and‑hold + slide‑to‑cancel gesture into a single motion; added smooth offset reset animation.
- **Provider‑based state** – moved input logic into `ChatInputProvider` for cleaner separation and testability (no more ad‑hoc `setState`).
- **Fully customizable styling** – introduced `WaveAnimationStyle` and `RecordingButtonStyle` (and related props on `ChatInputField`) to override colors, sizes, durations, decorations, etc.

## 2.0.1

- **hotfix** – use a column instead of a stack to place the input text under the chat list
